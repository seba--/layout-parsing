/**
 * A {@link CompilableLayoutNode} is a {@link LayoutNode} which can be compiled.
 * That means that the node is able to produce a single (!) expression of Java
 * code which takes an array of {@link AbstractParseNode}s and a {@link Map} for
 * environment variables which evaluates whether the kids are valid.<br>
 * It is very important that the
 * {@link #getCompiledCode(LocalVariableManager, boolean)} Method does only a
 * single expression returning its result. This makes concatenating of expressions
 * of child nodes very easy. The methods may use local variables to cache
 * calculation results. The declaration of these local variables must not be
 * included in the generated code. The names of these variables have to be
 * required from the {@link LocalVariableManager}. Please make sure that all
 * variables required in a generation method are released before the method
 * returns. <br>
 * The {@link CompilableLayoutNode} supports code generation for parse and
 * disambiguation time because some constraints cannot be evaluated at parse
 * time and to optimize the code. This behavior is modeled by the
 * {@link InvokeState} interface which distinguishes the tree cases: invokable
 * at parse time, not invokable at parse time and unsafely invokable parse time,
 * which means that the code has to check whether its input value are valid (ex.
 * not null).

 * @param <V>
 *          the return value of the LayoutNode for evaluation the tree at
