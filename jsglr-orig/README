===========================================

 JSGLR is an implementation of the Scannerless Generalized LR (SGLR)
 algorithm for Java. The JSGLR project only provides a parse table 
 evaluator; you will need to use the parse table generator (sdf2tbl)
 from the CWI SDF package in order to convert your SDF syntax 
 definitions into something JSGLR can understand.
